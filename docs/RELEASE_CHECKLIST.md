# Sakol Universe - Production Release Checklist

Before releasing Sakol Universe to staging or production environments, verify every item below:

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` pointing to production PostgreSQL instance with SSL enabled
- [ ] Cloudinary credentials verified (`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`)

## 2. Database & Data Integrity
